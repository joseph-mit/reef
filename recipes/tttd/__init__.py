"""TTT-Discover (arXiv:2601.16175): one method, one package.

Everything Reef-side that decides what TTT-Discover trains lives here:

- ``recipe`` — the TTT-Discover recipe class, its config fields, and the
  ``WeightTrainingSpec`` that binds the pieces below.
- ``processor`` — the exact-step barrier and grouped policy-data processor.
- ``report`` — the method-specific grouped rollout wire contract.
- ``preparer`` — the backend-agnostic step preparers: adaptive-entropic
  grouped advantages, and the group-mean control used in comparisons.
- ``slime`` — the Slime loss family and its torch objective hooks. It is
  imported by the training driver and workers only; this package's public
  surface never loads it, so the service process stays free of the Slime
  stack.
