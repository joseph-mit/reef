"""Harness-side building blocks for Test-Time Training to Discover.

``harness.agent`` contains the Reef-specific harness subclass.
``harness.run_controller`` pairs each search step with Reef's durable training
commit. ``harness.search`` implements the PUCT archive, the search algorithm,
and generic prompt construction. ``harness.scorer`` provides ``JudgeScorer``
(HTTP to a judge server) and ``ProgramScorer`` (direct subprocess sandbox).
``harness.sandbox`` provides the isolated subprocess executor.
``harness.methods`` names the training methods the same search can drive
(``TTTD_METHOD``) and where each keeps its state.
``harness.session`` builds the harness and run controller from a deployment
config, for both the Harbor agent and the Harbor-free ``run_local.py``.

The harness is task-agnostic: it scores every generated solution via a
``Scorer`` callable. The task instruction comes from the Harbor task's
``instruction.md``.
