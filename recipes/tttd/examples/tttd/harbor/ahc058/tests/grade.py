"""The verifier's whole job under the judge protocol: ask the judge for the
final result and write it down.

Generic — task authors never edit this file. It runs inside the task
environment after the agent's budget ends, calls ``GET $JUDGE_URL/final``
(final.py on the best submission if the task has one, else the best
session score), and writes:

- ``/logs/verifier/reward.json``  — ``{"reward": <float>}``
- ``/logs/verifier/reason.txt``   — the human-readable reason
- ``/logs/verifier/submissions.jsonl`` — one ``{"t", "score"}`` line per
  submission; reef-eval ingests these as the trusted score-over-time curve.
