Choose a recipe for agent learning
==================================

A recipe is picked along two axes: **what it evolves**, and **how it learns**.

+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
|                         | **Reactive:** learns from the traffic            | **Proactive:** generates its own         |
|                         | it already serves                                | attempts                                 |

| **Model weights**       | ``sao``: feedback on each attempt over a stream  | ``tttd``: repeated attempts at one       |
|                         | of tasks                                         | problem, at test time                    |

|                         |                                                  |                                          |

+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Harness:** prompts,   | ``skillclaw``: grows a skill pool from           | not available                            |
| rules, skills, config,  | the failures in its own served traffic           |                                          |

|                         | ``gepa``: rewrites the tree by reflecting on     |                                          |
|                         | the transcripts it already served                |                                          |

How a recipe is selected
------------------------

A deployment serves exactly one recipe, named by ``reef.recipe`` in its config.
Every scenario it creates uses that recipe. Requests never name a recipe, and
scenario snapshots do not store one. The scenario header is the only routing a
caller provides. The artifact repository is therefore deployment-owned: do not
point deployments configured with different recipes at the same repository.

.. code:: yaml

   reef:
     recipe: recipes.sao.recipe:SAORecipe
     batch_size: 1

``reef.recipe`` accepts the core value ``recipe``, a dotted class, or a preset.
Reef does not register or import learning methods. The ``recipes/`` tree in
this repository is a cookbook; installed method packages work the same way.
`Configuration <../reference/configuration.rst#recipe-configuration>`__
describes each spelling.

Every recipe has a checkpoint strategy, defaulting to ``EveryNVersions(1)``.
``checkpoint_every_n_versions`` is the shorter spelling in deployment YAML.

Run the recipe you chose
------------------------

Start with the `inference and feedback quickstart
<../getting-started/quickstart.rst>`__ if you have not sent traffic through
Reef yet. For a harness recipe, follow `Evolve agent prompts, rules, and skills
<evolve-your-harness.rst>`__. For a weight recipe, follow `Train model weights
from agent feedback <evolve-your-model.rst>`__. Each recipe page above provides
its own configuration and example.
